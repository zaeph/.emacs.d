  "When non-nil, automatically cleanup visited buffers.
When looking up symbols with `zp/lispy-goto-symbol-ibuf', it is
sometimes necessary to create buffers.  For instance, when the
definition of a symbol is found in a file that was not already
opened, a base-buffer needs to be created to be the base of the
lispy-spawn indirect buffer.  However, once the latter is killed,
there is little use to keep the base-buffer around, since we only
visited it for `zp/lispy-goto-symbol-ibuf'.

Setting this variable to non-nil enables the tracking and the
killing of those visited base-buffers.  The code tries to be
clever about the definition of a visited buffer, and it ensures
that a base-buffer is not prematurely killed when multiple
lispy-spawn indirect buffers are based on it."
